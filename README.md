This project leans heavily on this [video-series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I1eG-WLLrY) by [Hydrozoa](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ3I9UG_zvcQOs6tTPyyz_A) where he implements NEAT in java. I am following along in
javascript both to learn NEAT in a hands-on way and to hopefully arrive at a shareable library at the end.

If you are just starting out with programming neural-networks, the following are great hands-on, code-along tutorials:
